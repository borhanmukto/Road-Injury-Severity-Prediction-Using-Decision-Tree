# Accident Severity Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier



In this project, I analyzed Accident Data from Accident Research Institute in Bangladesh with recent datasets. Using this dataset I have prepared a model using Supervised Machine Learning Technics, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, AdaBoost



## Datasets

- [Accident Research Institute, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://ari.buet.ac.bd/)
